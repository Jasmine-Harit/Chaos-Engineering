WHAT IS CHAOS ENGINEERING?
Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in the system's capability to withstand turbulant conditions in production. In simple words, it is thoughtful planned experiments designed to reveal the weakness in systems. Basically you have to think something and you have to plan and experiment around that so that you can reveal the weakness in your system software, may be hardware or software system.
WHY DO WE NEED CHAOS ENGINEERING?
Nowadays, most of the companies moving towards the microservice architecture because it provides you flexibility. So, basically if you see these microservice architecture they are very complex and distributed and there are countless number of connections and dependencies with each other. So, it is practically very difficult to test each and every thing from traditional QA practices. So, you really want a mechanism where you can test these things pro-actively. That's why we need Chaos Engineering so that, we can find issues in the large distributed systems.
PRINCIPLES OF CHAOS ENGINEERING
1. Define steady state
2. Form your hypothesis
3. Plan and run your experiments
4. Measure and learn
