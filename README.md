WHAT IS CHAOS ENGINEERING?
Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in the system's capability to withstand turbulant conditions in production. In simple words, it is thoughtful planned experiments designed to reveal the weakness in systems. Basically you have to think something and you have to plan and experiment around that so that you can reveal the weakness in your system software, may be hardware or software system.
